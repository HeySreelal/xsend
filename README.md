## Overview

xSend is a simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline the process of sending files from your local machine to your Telegram account or chat. Whether you're sharing documents, images, or any other file, xSend makes the process quick and hassle-free.

## üìñ Usage

To use xSend, follow these simple steps:

1. **Build and Save the Binary:**
   - Build the xSend binary and save it in your system's PATH.

2. **Run the Command:**
   - Open your terminal and execute the following command:
     ```bash
     xsend <path-to-file>
     ```

3. **Bot Token Setup:**
   - Create a Telegram bot by interacting with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and obtain the bot token.
   - Save the bot token as the environment variable `BOT_TOKEN`.

4. **Chat ID Setup:**
   - Get your Telegram Chat ID using [@myidbot](https://t.me/myidbot) or any other method.
   - Optionally, save the chat ID as the environment variable `CHAT_ID` for default settings.

5. **Send Files:**
   - Execute the xSend command with the path to the file you want to send:
      ```bash
      xsend <path-to-file> -c <chat-id>   # Specify chat ID if different from default
      ```

   - Optionally, you now have the ability to send file content as a message. Just specify the `-t` flag. Please note that if the file is too large (> 4096 characters) or if the file is not a text file, this will not work.
      ```bash
      xsend <path-to-file> -t -c <chat-id>   # Specify chat ID if different from default
      ```
   - Again, optionally, you can specify if the file is a media file (currently, photo - `jpg`, `png`, `jpeg`, video - `mp4`, `mkv`, `webm`) using the `-m` flag.
      ```
      xsend <path> -m
      ```
   - So generally speaking, the command syntax is as follows:
      ```bash
      xsend <path-to-file> [-t] [-m] [-c <chat-id>]
      ```

## üçÆ Even more customization 
You can create a custom configuration settings file to explicitly specify chats to store your file based on file extension. For example, if you want your pdf files to be sent to a particular Telegram chat a custom config file would be a great time saver for you.

To setup custom config file, you need to create a JSON file with the schema specified in [config_schema.json](./config_schema.json). Inside the `chat_id_map` property you can map the file extension to chat id.

Example of Custom Config File:

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeySreelal/xsend/main/config_schema.json",
    "chat_id_map": {
        "apk": {
            "id": -1001344696859
        },
        "png": {
            "id": -1001742213798,
            "topic": 176
        }
    }
}
```

Now, set the Environment Variable `XSEND_CONFIG_PATH` to the absolute path to the custom configuration JSON file. That's it.

## üë∑ Build Help

You can build the xSend binary using the following command:

```bash
dart compile exe bin/xsend.dart -o xsend
```

## Environment Variables

- `BOT_TOKEN`: Telegram bot token obtained from [@BotFather].
- `CHAT_ID` (Optional): Default chat ID for sending files. If not specified, the tool will prompt for a chat ID during execution.
- `XSEND_CONFIG_PATH` (Optional): Custom configuration file.

## Example

```bash
xsend /path/to/myfile.txt -c 12345678
```
